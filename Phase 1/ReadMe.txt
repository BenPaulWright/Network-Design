Compilation:			
	The submitted code contains a folder "NetDesign Phase 1" in the format of a Visual Studio workspace containing two projects, Client and Server.
	In order to build the projects, the workspace "NetDesign Phase 1.sln" must be opened with visual studio. The project is set to build both cliend and server in Release mode.

Running:
	If you do not wish to compile the code yourself, I have included two EXEs; Client.ex and Server.exe
	These can be run directly.
	
	Note ** The executables require .Net Runtime to be installed in order to launch
