Compilation:			
	The submitted code contains a folder "NetDesign Phase 3" in the format of a Visual Studio workspace containing four projects. Client and Server are nearly identical and are made up almost entirely of methods from the class libraries NetDesign_Lib and NetDesign_UC_Lib.
	In order to build the projects, the workspace "NetDesign Phase 3.sln" must be opened with visual studio. The project is set to build both cliend and server in Release mode.

Running:
	If you do not wish to compile the code yourself, I have included two EXEs; Client.ex and Server.exe
	These can be run directly.
	
	Note ** The executables require .Net Runtime to be installed in order to launch
